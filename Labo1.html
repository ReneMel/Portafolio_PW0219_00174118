    <h1>Vex Robotics</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Vex Robotics Competitions</strong> is a <i>robotics</i> competition for elementary through university students. It is a subset of VEX Robotics, which is in turn a subset of Innovation First International. The VEX Robotics World Championship, run by the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation[2] in April 2018 was named the largest robotics competition in the world by <strong>World Records</strong> </p>
    <p>There are three divisions of this robotics competition meant for different age groups and skill levels: VEX EDR, VEX U, and VEX IQ. VEX EDR is for middle and high school students, VEX U is for university students, and VEX IQ is for elementary and middle school students only. In the competition, students are given a yearly challenge, and must design, build, program, and drive a robot to complete the challenge as best as they can. </p>

        <h3>Vex EDR</h3>
        <p>VEX EDR is a robotics competition for middle school and high school students with two different divisions: middle school and high school. In this division, aluminum and steel parts are used, and the robots are built using the VEX EDR Design System. Students from Grades 6-12 may participate. Additionally, while the visual code editor is still available, most students take advantage of VEX's RobotC for their programming. At tournaments, teams participate in qualifying matches where two teams vs two teams participate. In the Elimination Rounds, alliances of two teams are selected by the top-seeded teams, and the alliance who wins the finals is the winner of the tournament.</p>

        <h3>VEX U</h3>
        <p>The VEX U level competition is for college and university students. The rules are nearly identical for this division as for the EDR division, but VEX U teams are allowed to take advantage of more customization and greater flexibility than other levels. Also, their robot creation is limited by the need to find effective costs and a restricted development environment in order to model a real-world situation. In addition, in past competitions, Vex U teams needed to create two different complementary robots, one big and one small, and program them to work together to defeat opponent teams</p>

        <h3>Vex IQ</h3>
        <p>The VEX IQ Challenge, presented by the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation, provides elementary and middle school students with exciting, open-ended robotics and research project challenges that enhance their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills through hands-on, student-centered learning. A VEX IQ Robotics set is used, with plastic pieces that snap together using pegs, and it is extremely easy to construct a robot. The students use a graphical software to program the robot. There are two parts to the contests: Robot Skills, which is a single robot trying to score as many points as possible, and the Teamwork Challenge, where two robots attempt to work together to complete the same task.</p>
